# Decisions

Decisions made during implementation that `spec.md` does not cover.

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-24 | No `.python-version` file; Python 3.12 is pinned via `requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.13"` | A `.python-version` pin made pyenv shims hide the `uv` binary on the dev machine. uv still selects 3.12 from `requires-python`. |
| 2026-09-24 | Makefile uses `UV ?= uv` | Lets developers point at a specific uv binary (`make check UV=/path/to/uv`). |
| 2026-09-24 | Slow tests are excluded by default (`addopts = "-m 'not slow'"`); run them with `make test-slow` | Keeps the default test run fast and free of heavy deps (torch). |
